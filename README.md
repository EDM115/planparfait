> Builds for Windows and Web may come later  
> Linux, MacOS and iOS may come later but it's very unlikely

### Why isn't the source code available ?

Well I have it and can push it right away, but that wouldn't be without 3 major constraints :  
1. The code exported from FlutterFlow is straight incomplete
2. Builds aren't reproducible yet, things are missing, and I'd like to give exact instructions for you to try out
3. Some secrets are in plain text in the code, meanwhile some essential config elements are missing. Can't push for security reasons

### The versionning
  
Why v1.3.0 ?
well everything have been developed on FlutterFlow.io, without version control
